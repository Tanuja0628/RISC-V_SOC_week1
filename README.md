# RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop with SKY130

Welcome to the RTL Workshop, a hands-on journey through Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital optimization using the open-source SKY130 PDK. This repository contains structured content for learners to experiment, code, and master practical digital design concepts.

# 🚀 Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed for students, hobbyists, and engineers aiming to:

- Learn Verilog RTL design and simulation techniques

- Use Icarus Verilog and GTKWave for simulation and waveform visualization

- Perform logic synthesis with Yosys using the SkyWater 130nm open-source PDK

- Understand timing libraries, D flip-flop coding styles, optimization strategies, and RTL best practices

By the end of this workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and synthesizing digital circuits efficiently and correctly.

# 🛠 Prerequisites

- Before diving in, ensure you have:

- Basic digital logic knowledge: gates, flip-flops, multiplexers, and FSMs

- Familiarity with Linux shell commands

- A Linux environment (or WSL for Windows/macOS)

### Essential tools installed:

- git

- iverilog

- gtkwave

- yosys

- Text editor (gedit, VSCode, or vim)

# 📅 Workshop Structure

The content is organized by day, each with a dedicated folder, README, and labs:

Day	Topics Covered
Day 1	Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis
Day 2	Timing Libraries, Synthesis Approaches, Efficient Flip-Flop Coding
Day 3	Combinational & Sequential Optimization
Day 4	Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments, Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch
Day 5	Optimization in Synthesis

Each day includes:

- Concept explanations with examples

- Step-by-step labs with code and outputs

- Practical tips and best practices for RTL design
