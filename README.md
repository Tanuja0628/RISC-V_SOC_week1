## About this Workshop
Week 1 of the India RISC-V SoC Chip Tapeout Program focused on synthesis and optimization of various Verilog files, while also highlighting the common mistakes often made in Verilog design and how to avoid them.

This workshop is tailored for students and engineers eager to strengthen their hardware design skills.  
Here youâ€™ll learn how to:  
- Write RTL modules (Verilog/VHDL)  
- Build testbenches for simulation  
- Verify correctness with assertions  
- Understand the design flow from coding to validation
